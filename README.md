# fleet2snipe

Sync device inventory from [Fleet](https://fleetdm.com) into [Snipe-IT](https://snipeitapp.com). Written in Go.

Inspired by [`grokability/jamf2snipe`](https://github.com/grokability/jamf2snipe) — same purpose, but sourced from Fleet (osquery-based, cross-platform) instead of Jamf Pro, with a webhook listener for near-real-time updates and richer mapping options (gjson, policies, saved queries, labels).

## What you get

- **One binary, two modes** — `sync` (full reconciliation, run from cron) and `serve` (HTTP listener for Fleet activity webhooks; pulls one host per event).
- **Five overlapping ways to map data into Snipe-IT custom fields**: gjson paths, policy pass/fail, saved-query result columns, per-label boolean, full label list.
- **Idempotent `setup`** that creates the custom fields in Snipe-IT, associates them with your fieldset, and writes the resulting `field_mapping` back to your `settings.yaml`.
- **Hand-rolled Fleet client** — Bearer auth, paginated listing, `Retry-After`-aware backoff. No `github.com/fleetdm/fleet/v4` import bloat.
- **`michellepellon/go-snipeit`** for Snipe-IT, wrapped with dry-run enforcement and token-bucket rate limiting.
- **Device images** for Apple hardware via [appledb.dev](https://appledb.dev), attached to newly-created Snipe-IT models.
- **`--dry-run`** gated at every mutation; local **cache** for offline dev (`--use-cache`).
- **Custom-field rejection retry** — if Snipe-IT rejects a field for being outside the model's fieldset, fleet2snipe strips it and retries so the rest of the update still lands.
- **Distroless Dockerfile** and sample **systemd unit** included.

## Quick start

```sh
go build ./...

cp settings.example.yaml settings.yaml
$EDITOR settings.yaml                  # fill in Fleet/Snipe credentials + IDs

./fleet2snipe test                     # verify connectivity to both
./fleet2snipe setup                    # create custom fields in Snipe-IT
./fleet2snipe sync --dry-run --verbose # preview
./fleet2snipe sync                     # do it
```

## Authentication

**Fleet** — create an `api_only` user (Settings → Users → Create user → check **API only**), then copy their API token. Dedicate the account: any other login as that user rotates the token.

**Snipe-IT** — Account → Manage API Keys → Create New Token.

Set credentials via `settings.yaml` or env vars: `FLEET_URL`, `FLEET_TOKEN`, `SNIPE_URL`, `SNIPE_API_KEY`, `FLEET2SNIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## Two modes, one engine

### `sync` — full reconciliation

```sh
./fleet2snipe sync                            # full sweep
./fleet2snipe sync --force --verbose          # ignore freshness check
./fleet2snipe sync --serial C02XK1JJJG5J      # one host
./fleet2snipe sync --identifier <uuid|hostname|serial|node_key>
./fleet2snipe sync --use-cache                # replay last fetch from .cache/hosts.json
./fleet2snipe sync --update-only              # never create new assets
```

Run on a cron (every 15 min is typical) as your authoritative reconciliation loop. Fleet doesn't emit events when osquery re-reports, so detail drift (free disk space, IPs, OS minor versions) is only caught by polling.

### `serve` — activity-driven wake-ups

```sh
./fleet2snipe serve --verbose
```

In Fleet, **Settings → Integrations → Automations → Activities** webhook, posting to:

```
https://<your-host>:9090/webhook/fleet?secret=<your-webhook-secret>
```

The activity payload is treated as a **wake-up signal**. fleet2snipe extracts every `host_id` it can find in the batch, dedupes, then `GET`s `/api/v1/fleet/hosts/{id}` for each one and reconciles into Snipe-IT.

- No activity-type allowlist — any current or future activity that references a host triggers a refresh.
- A burst (e.g. enrollment + MDM enrolled + software installed for the same host, all landing together) becomes **one** Fleet pull and one Snipe-IT update.
- A 404 from the detail fetch (host deleted mid-flight) is handled silently.
- `deleted_host` / `deleted_multiple_hosts` activities are logged but the Snipe-IT asset is **left in place** — retire manually. We never auto-delete inventory.

Fleet's other automation webhooks (host status, failing policies, vulnerabilities) fire on operational events rather than inventory changes, so we don't subscribe to them.

## How fields get populated

Five sources feed the same `custom_fields` map; values that come back empty are skipped (we never overwrite Snipe-IT data with `""`).

### 1. `field_mapping` — gjson paths into the host JSON

Auto-populated by `fleet2snipe setup`. Each entry is either a bare gjson path or an object with `path` + optional `transform`. Both forms coexist:

```yaml
sync:
  field_mapping:
    _snipeit_fleet_host_id_1: id                # bare string — path only
    _snipeit_fleet_os_version_2: os_version
    _snipeit_mdm_enrollment_3: mdm.enrollment_status
    _snipeit_first_label_4: labels.0.name

    _snipeit_ram_5:                              # object form — adds a transform
      path: memory
      transform: bytes_to_gb                     # 17179869184 bytes → "17"
    _snipeit_storage_6:
      path: gigs_total_disk_space
      transform: gib_to_gb                       # 465.5 GiB → "500"
```

Full [gjson](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson) syntax (arrays, filters, modifiers) is supported on `path`.

**Transforms** standardise units and rendering before the value lands in Snipe-IT. Fleet emits memory as `int64` bytes and disk space as `float` *GiB* (despite the misleading `gigs_*` field name) — without a transform you'd get inconsistent units across the same fieldset.

| Category        | Name              | Input                       | Output                                                               |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unit conversion | `bytes_to_gb`     | int64 bytes                 | decimal GB (`bytes / 10⁹`), rounded integer                          |
|                 | `bytes_to_gib`    | int64 bytes                 | binary GiB (`bytes / 2³⁰`), rounded integer — matches About This Mac |
|                 | `bytes_to_mb`     | int64 bytes                 | decimal MB (`bytes / 10⁶`), rounded integer                          |
|                 | `bytes_to_tb`     | int64 bytes                 | decimal TB (`bytes / 10¹²`), rounded integer                         |
|                 | `gib_to_gb`       | float GiB                   | decimal GB (`GiB × 1.073741824`), rounded                            |
| Time            | `unix_to_iso`     | int64 seconds-since-epoch   | `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` UTC (matches existing RFC3339 normalisation)   |
| String          | `uppercase`       | any string                  | `strings.ToUpper`                                                    |
|                 | `lowercase`       | any string                  | `strings.ToLower`                                                    |
|                 | `mac_colons`      | any MAC-ish string          | `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff` (colon-separated, lowercase)                     |
|                 | `mac_dashes`      | any MAC-ish string          | `aa-bb-cc-dd-ee-ff` (dash-separated, lowercase)                      |
|                 | `base64_to_mac`   | 6-byte base64 string        | `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff` — decodes Fleet's ioreg `IOMACAddress` plist data |
| Display         | `comma_thousands` | integer (or numeric string) | `1,234,567` US-style thousands grouping                              |
|                 | `bool_yes_no`     | bool / numeric / string     | `Yes` / `No` for true-ish / false-ish; `""` for unknown values       |

**Empty-on-no-data rule**: zero, missing, and unparseable values resolve to `""` for the unit conversions and `unix_to_iso` so we never clobber real Snipe-IT data with a placeholder from a host that hasn't reported in yet. For the cosmetic transforms (`comma_thousands`, case), a legitimate `0` or empty string passes through unchanged.

**MAC normaliser** strips every non-hex character then re-inserts the chosen separator between byte pairs, so colon, dash, dot (Cisco `aabb.ccdd.eeff`), and run-on `AABBCCDDEEFF` formats all converge to the same form. Inputs that don't reduce to exactly 12 hex characters return `""`.

Unknown transform names are **rejected at config load** with an error naming both the bad transform and the field that used it — typos surface immediately rather than per-host.

### Per-platform mapping overrides

Every mapping section (`field_mapping`, `policy_mapping`, `query_mapping`, `label_mapping`) accepts per-platform additions and overrides under `sync.per_platform.<platform>.<mapping_type>`. The engine merges each platform's block with the corresponding global mapping for hosts of that platform; on key conflict the platform-specific value wins.

```yaml
sync:
  field_mapping:
    _snipeit_host_id_1: id              # global — applies to every platform

  per_platform:
    darwin:
      field_mapping:
        _snipeit_filevault_20:
          path: disk_encryption_enabled
          transform: bool_yes_no
      policy_mapping:
        _snipeit_compliance_21: "macOS baseline compliance"

    ios:
      # iOS has no osquery, so no policy/query mappings — just MDM-derived fields.
      field_mapping:
        _snipeit_supervised_24:
          path: mdm.is_supervised
          transform: bool_yes_no
```

**Resolution**: an iOS host gets `_snipeit_host_id_1` (from global) and `_snipeit_supervised_24` (from `per_platform.ios`); a darwin host gets `_snipeit_host_id_1` plus the FileVault field and policy.

**Saved queries** referenced under `per_platform.<platform>.query_mapping` are fetched once per unique query name at warm time — referencing the same query from N platforms still costs one Fleet API call. The report is indexed by `host_id` so per-host lookups stay O(1) regardless of platform.

**`populate_policies` / `populate_labels`** on the list endpoint are auto-enabled when *any* mapping (global or per-platform) needs the data, so you don't have to remember to flip the flag when adding a darwin-only policy.

**Transform validation** runs on per-platform `field_mapping` entries too — typos in a platform block fail config load with a clear error naming both the platform and the transform name.

### 2. `policy_mapping` — Fleet policies (compliance "controls")

```yaml
sync:
  policy_mapping:
    _snipeit_filevault_10: "FileVault is enabled"
    _snipeit_gatekeeper_11: "Gatekeeper is enabled"
```

Writes `"pass"` / `"fail"` / `""` per host. Free piggyback on the host detail — `populate_policies` is auto-enabled when this map is non-empty.

### 3. `query_mapping` — osquery saved-query results

```yaml
sync:
  query_mapping:
    _snipeit_kernel_version_12:
      query: "Kernel version"
      column: "kernel_version"
    _snipeit_ad_domain_13:
      query: "Joined AD domain"
      column: "domain"
```

The saved query must have **discard_data=false** (i.e. "Save results in Fleet"). Each configured query is fetched **once per sync run** and indexed by `host_id` — a 5,000-host fleet with three query mappings costs 3 API calls, not 15,000.

#### Recipe: hardware Wi-Fi MAC on macOS (sidesteps Private Wi-Fi Address)

The default `primary_mac` Fleet returns for macOS hosts is the **Private Wi-Fi Address** — a per-SSID randomized MAC the OS rotates whenever the host joins a new network. For stable inventory tracking you want the burned-in hardware MAC instead.

Fleet's `fleetd` agent ships an `ioreg` osquery table that wraps `/usr/sbin/ioreg -a` and surfaces IOKit properties — including `IOMACAddress` on the underlying Wi-Fi adapter, which bypasses Private Wi-Fi Address because IOKit sits below the kernel's MAC-rewriting layer.

**Step 1** — in Fleet, create a saved query (Settings → Queries → Add) named e.g. `"macOS hardware Wi-Fi MAC"` with **Save results in Fleet** enabled:

```sql
SELECT value AS mac_b64
FROM ioreg
WHERE c = 'IOSkywalkLegacyEthernet'  -- macOS 12+ Wi-Fi adapter class
  AND key = 'IOMACAddress'
LIMIT 1;
```

(Pre-macOS-12 systems use `AppleBCMWLANCore` or `IO80211Controller`. Widen the `c =` filter if you need to support older versions.)

**Step 2** — in fleet2snipe, wire it up under the darwin platform with the `base64_to_mac` transform. ioreg surfaces `IOMACAddress` as a plist `<data>` block which fleetd serialises as base64; `base64_to_mac` decodes 6 bytes into `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`:

```yaml
sync:
  per_platform:
    darwin:
      query_mapping:
        _snipeit_mac_address_1:
          query: "macOS hardware Wi-Fi MAC"
          column: "mac_b64"
          transform: base64_to_mac    # "cIzyxNK1" → 70:8c:f2:c4:d2:b5
```

Fleet has to have collected the query result for at least one interval before the first sync sees data. After that, the hardware MAC overrides the rotating `primary_mac` for darwin hosts and stays stable across SSID changes.

Tracking upstream: this is filed as a Fleet bug at <https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/46112>. When Fleet adds a stable `hardware_mac` field, this recipe goes away.

### 4. `label_mapping` — per-label membership

```yaml
sync:
  label_mapping:
    _snipeit_is_engineering_15: "Engineering laptops"
    _snipeit_is_kiosk_16: "Kiosks"
```

Writes `"yes"` if the host belongs to the named label, `"no"` otherwise. Auto-enables `populate_labels`.

### 5. `labels_field` — full label list

```yaml
sync:
  labels_field: _snipeit_fleet_labels_17
```

A single Snipe-IT field that receives an alphabetised, comma-separated list of every label the host belongs to. Sorted output means a stable membership set produces a stable field value — no PATCH churn.

## Checkout to assigned user

Mirrors `jamf2snipe -u / -ui / -uf` but generalised across whichever Fleet field carries the user identifier. Disabled by default.

```yaml
sync:
  checkout:
    enabled: true
    user_field: "end_users.0.idp_username"  # gjson path into the host JSON
    match_field: "username"                 # snipe field: username | email | employee_num
    mode: "assign"                          # assign | sync | force
```

- `user_field` is any gjson path that resolves to a single string. Good choices: `end_users.0.idp_username` (Fleet Premium with IDP), `end_users.0.email`, or `users.#(type=="regular").username` (first regular OS user from osquery).
- `match_field` is the Snipe-IT user field to look the value up against. Match is case-insensitive.
- `mode`: `assign` only checks out when the asset is currently unassigned (default, like `-u`); `sync` also reassigns when the user differs (like `-ui`); `force` always (re)assigns (like `-uf`).
- All Snipe-IT users are loaded once at warm time and indexed for O(1) lookups, so per-host sync stays cheap regardless of fleet size.
- Reassignments are handled correctly: Snipe-IT's checkout endpoint refuses to overwrite an existing assignment, so we check the asset in first when the desired user differs.
- A Fleet user that has no Snipe-IT counterpart is logged at info and skipped — fleet2snipe never auto-creates users.

## Setup subcommand

`fleet2snipe setup` is **idempotent** and safe to re-run. It creates / updates a baseline set of `Fleet: …` custom fields in Snipe-IT, associates them with your configured fieldset, and rewrites `sync.field_mapping` in `settings.yaml` (preserving comments) with the resulting `db_column_name`s.

**Manual prereqs in Snipe-IT** (one time):

1. Create at least one fieldset → `snipe_it.custom_fieldset_id`. Optionally create one fieldset per platform (e.g. one for macOS, one for Windows, one for mobile) and list them under `snipe_it.fieldset_ids` — `sync` will attach the right fieldset to each auto-created model based on the host's Fleet platform. `setup` associates every `Fleet: …` custom field with every configured fieldset in one idempotent pass.
2. Create a status label for new assets → `snipe_it.default_status_id`.
3. Create one or more model categories (e.g. per OS family) → `snipe_it.category_ids`.

Manufacturers can be left blank — `sync` auto-creates them from Fleet's `hardware_vendor`.

### Per-platform fieldsets

Analogous to jamf2snipe's `computer_custom_fieldset_id` / `mobile_custom_fieldset_id`, but generalised across every Fleet platform:

```yaml
snipe_it:
  custom_fieldset_id: 4           # fallback for platforms not listed below
  fieldset_ids:
    darwin: 5                     # MacBooks / iMacs / Mac minis
    ios: 6                        # iPhones
    ipados: 6                     # iPads share the iOS fieldset
    windows: 7
    linux: 8
    chrome: 9
```

`setup` writes every field to all of those fieldsets. You can then prune fields that don't apply per-platform inside Snipe-IT (e.g. remove `Fleet: Disk Encryption` from the Chrome fieldset).

## Platform notes (osquery vs MDM)

Fleet collects data differently depending on what's running on the host, so several mapping sources are **available only on osquery platforms**. Plan your fieldsets accordingly — per-platform `fieldset_ids` is the easiest way to keep iOS assets from being haunted by `Fleet: CPU Brand` columns that will never populate.

| Platform           | Data source                              | What works                                                                                             | What's missing / thin                                                                                  |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **darwin / linux / windows** | Fleet osquery agent            | Everything: full `field_mapping`, `policy_mapping`, `query_mapping`, `label_mapping`, software inventory | —                                                                                                      |
| **chrome**         | `fleetd-chrome` browser extension        | Identity, MDM state, labels, **a subset** of osquery-style policies and saved queries via the extension's supported tables | Tables that don't exist in the extension's narrower osquery surface (most filesystem / kernel / `system_info` columns), software inventory, things like `cpu_brand`/`memory` that the extension doesn't expose |
| **ios / ipados**   | Fleet MDM (no osquery, no extension)     | Hardware identity (serial / model / uuid), OS version, MDM enrollment state, labels via Smart criteria, end_users | `policy_mapping` (no osquery to evaluate), `query_mapping` (no osquery to run), software inventory, `cpu_brand`, `memory`, `gigs_*`, host-detail `disk_encryption_enabled` |
| **android**        | Fleet MDM only (no osquery, no extension) | Same surface as iOS: identity, OS version, MDM enrollment, labels, end_users                            | Same gaps as iOS                                                                                       |
| **tvos / visionos**| Fleet MDM only (no osquery)              | Same as iOS — basic identity only                                                                       | Same as iOS                                                                                            |

**Practical implications**:

- A `policy_mapping` entry for `"FileVault enabled"` will always return `""` on iOS/iPadOS hosts — Fleet has no way to evaluate it. The engine's "empty-on-missing" rule means the field stays blank rather than getting an incorrect `"fail"`.
- `query_mapping` results only land for hosts that actually ran the query. iOS / Chrome hosts return no rows; the per-host lookup misses and the field stays blank.
- Software-inventory–based mappings (`field_mapping` paths into `software[]`) are osquery-only. Enable `populate_software=true` and use them only on osquery platforms.
- The `Fleet: Disk Encryption` field setup creates is meaningful on darwin/windows (osquery reads filevault/bitlocker state), partially populated on iOS via MDM (you get `mdm.disk_encryption_enabled` not the host-detail `disk_encryption_enabled`), and absent on Linux unless you wire up your own osquery extension or saved query.
- Use `platform_filter` to skip platforms entirely if a sync run targets a specific tier (e.g. only push macOS into a "Laptop" category).

The transforms (`bool_yes_no`, `bytes_to_gb`, etc.) all work uniformly regardless of platform — they operate on whatever value Fleet does return, including the empty case.

## Operating notes

- **Match key**: `hardware_serial`. Hosts with no serial are skipped. Two Snipe-IT assets sharing a serial → flagged and skipped to avoid clobbering the wrong record.
- **Freshness check**: a host whose Fleet `detail_updated_at` is older than Snipe-IT's `updated_at` is skipped. Use `--force` (or `sync.force: true`) to ignore.
- **Asset tag**: template-driven. `sync.asset_tag.template` is a string with `{gjson.path}` placeholders interpolated from the Fleet host JSON (e.g. `"CG-{hardware_serial}"`, `"{platform}-{id}"`). `sync.asset_tag.platform_templates` overrides per Fleet platform (mirrors kandji2snipe's per-platform patterns). An explicit empty string asks Snipe-IT to auto-assign (jamf2snipe's `--auto_incrementing`). Legacy `sync.asset_tag_prefix` is still honored as a shortcut for `"{prefix}{id}"`.
- **Model creation**: uses `hardware_model` (e.g. `MacBookPro17,1`) as both the model name and number, attaches the fieldset, and on Apple devices fetches an image from appledb.dev when `sync.model_images: true`.
- **Custom-field rejection retry**: if Snipe-IT rejects fields with "not available on this Asset Model's fieldset", fleet2snipe strips the bad keys and retries once so the rest of the update applies. Re-run `fleet2snipe setup` to fix the underlying fieldset config.
- **Platform filtering**: `sync.platform_filter: ["darwin", "windows"]` to limit which platforms get synced.

## Docker

```sh
docker build -t fleet2snipe .

docker run --rm \
  -e FLEET_URL=https://fleet.example.com \
  -e FLEET_TOKEN=... \
  -e SNIPE_URL=https://snipe.example.com \
  -e SNIPE_API_KEY=... \
  -e FLEET2SNIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=... \
  -v $(pwd)/settings.yaml:/app/settings.yaml:ro \
  -p 9090:9090 fleet2snipe serve
```

Or run a one-shot `sync` from a Kubernetes / Cloud Run cron with the same flags.

## Why hand-roll the Fleet client?

`github.com/fleetdm/fleet/v4/server/service` exposes a usable Go client, but importing it drags in the full Fleet server module (MySQL, NanoMDM, AWS SDKs, MaxMind, k8s libs, …). For a small CLI that only needs five endpoints — list hosts, get host, list queries, get query report, list labels — a few hundred lines of `net/http` is the right trade.
